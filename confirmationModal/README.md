# [Confirmation modal](https://www.acefrontend.com/challenges/modal)

Jimmy from the user testing department has just discovered a big problem… Customers are accidentally removing items from their shopping cart. This is frustrating the users and costing the company thousands in lost sales!

Create a button that, when clicked, shows a confirmation modal like this:

Clicking the “cancel” button or the gray overlay should close the modal. You do not need to implement any action for the “delete” button.
