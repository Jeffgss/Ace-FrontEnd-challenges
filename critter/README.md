# [Critter](https://www.acefrontend.com/challenges/critter)

Geoff has a killer startup idea - He calls it “Critter”, think “Twitter” but for bugs and insects. Geoff has done the research and decided that this is a HUGE market that is currently underserved. There’s an estimated 200 million insects for every 1 human, so this could be the next trillion dollar startup.

The backend API has already been started, but a simple front end interface is needed to demo to investors.

Here’s a mock from the designer:

![Challenge example](https://www.acefrontend.com/c/critter/critter-mock.png)

Fetch the feed data from the API endpoint, then render it to the page according to the mock.

The feed API is located at:
https://www.acefrontend.com/c/critter/feed.json

A helper function to format the date has also been provided.
